## Calligraphy Newsletter
This will be a blog geared toward combining western and asian calligraphy practices.

### Art Style
These calligraphy pages will use the soot from charcoal to draw with reed pens, windsor brushes, dip pens, and sumi brushes.

### Homemade Ink
All ink used in these pages will use homemade charcoal ink, but sometimes I will use other things kinds ink as well.
